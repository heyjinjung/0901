# Phase 2: Admin UI Wiring Report

## ✅ Summary
- Admin UI pages wired to backend endpoints with basic flows:
  - Stats: `/api/admin/stats` ✅
  - Campaigns create: `/api/admin/campaigns` ✅
  - Shop list (read-only): `/api/admin/shop/items` ✅

## 🔌 Endpoints verified
- Backend health: 200 ✅
- Frontend root: 200 ✅
- OpenAPI re-exported: `cc-webapp/backend/current_openapi.json` ✅
- Frontend smoke tests: 2/2 passing ✅

## 🧪 Tests
- Added tiny smoke tests ensuring admin pages import successfully.
- Jest configured for Next.js; tests run in frontend container.

## 🛠️ Notes
- TypeScript: fixed event typings in admin pages and price formatting.
- Known non-blocking type-check issue in `components/ui/Sidebar.tsx` (to be addressed separately).

## 🎯 Next
- Optional: add retries/metrics to campaign dispatcher and stronger dedupe.
- Expand admin UI for shop CRUD as needed.
