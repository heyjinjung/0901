# Casino-Club F2P Project Inspection Report
Generated: 2025-08-07 19:20:44

## Inspection Results
- Backend duplicate files: 4 categories
- Missing APIs: 4731
- Docker files: 6
- Frontend design consistency: Maintained

## Immediate Actions Required
- Backend duplicate files need cleanup 
- 4731 APIs need implementation 
- Docker files need consolidation

## Detailed Action Plan

### 1. Backend Duplicate Files Cleanup

#### Main Files (3 duplicates)
- `main.py` - Primary file to keep
- `main_fixed.py` - Analyze differences and merge into main
- `main_simple.py` - Evaluate if needed for simplified mode

#### Auth Files (4 duplicates)
- `app/routers/auth.py` - Primary file to keep
- `app/routers/auth_clean.py` - Compare and merge improvements
- `app/routers/auth_simple.py` - Evaluate if needed
- `app/routers/auth_temp.py` - Likely temporary, can be removed
- Additional auth files in non-standard locations to be reviewed:
  - `app/auth/auth_service.py`
  - `app/auth/auth_endpoints.py`
  - `app/api/v1/auth_router.py`

#### Game Files (3 duplicates)
- `app/routers/games.py` - Primary file to keep
- `app/routers/games_fixed.py` - Compare and merge fixes
- `app/routers/games_direct.py` - Evaluate if needed

#### Config Files (2 duplicates)
- Review and consolidate configuration files

### 2. API Implementation Strategy

- Create priority tiers for the 4731 missing API implementations
- Tier 1: Core user functionality (auth, profile, basic game mechanics)
- Tier 2: Game features (slots, gacha, battlepass)
- Tier 3: Advanced features (personalization, adult content)
- Develop incremental implementation plan with testing milestones

### 3. Docker Environment Consolidation

Current files:
- `docker-compose.yml` - Main file to keep
- `docker-compose.override.dev.yml` - Keep for development overrides
- `docker-compose.standalone.yml` - Evaluate standalone needs
- `docker-compose.simple.yml` - Consider merging with main
- `docker-compose.basic.yml` - Consider removing if redundant
- `docker-compose-example.yml` - Keep as example only, rename to `.example`

Target structure:
- `docker-compose.yml` - Production defaults
- `docker-compose.override.dev.yml` - Development overrides
- `docker-compose.test.yml` - Testing environment

## Implementation Timeline

1. Week 1: File analysis and backup
   - Create backup branch of current state
   - Compare duplicate files for differences
   - Document key features to preserve

2. Week 2: Backend file consolidation
   - Merge duplicate main files
   - Consolidate auth implementation
   - Unify game endpoints
   - Update import references

3. Week 3: Docker consolidation
   - Test each configuration
   - Merge into target structure
   - Document environment differences

4. Week 4: API implementation kickoff
   - Begin Tier 1 API implementation
   - Establish testing strategy
   - Update documentation

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Create backup branch
- [x] Complete file comparison report
- [ ] Consolidate main.py variants
- [x] Consolidate auth.py variants
- [x] Consolidate games.py variants
- [ ] Reduce Docker files to 3
- [x] Update documentation
